# GithubExercise2

## Overview
This project, **GithubExercise2**, is a Python program that generates an array of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000, sorts the array, and calculates the median, mode, and range of the sorted array. The program demonstrates basic array manipulation, sorting, and statistical calculations.

## Features

1. **Random Array Generation**:
   - Generates an array of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000.
   - Prints the unsorted array.

2. **Array Sorting**:
   - Sorts the array in ascending order.
   - Prints the sorted array.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - Calculates the median of the sorted array.
   - If the array length is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle value.
   - Prints the median.

4. **Mode Calculation**:
   - Calculates the mode(s) of the sorted array.
   - The mode is the number(s) that appear most frequently in the array.
   - Prints the mode(s).

5. **Range Calculation**:
   - Calculates the range of the sorted array.
   - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.
   - Prints the range.
